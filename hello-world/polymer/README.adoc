= Hello World (polymer)

Miraj Hello World using polymer components.

[source,shell]
----
$ boot monitor pages target
----

This will compile, link, and write all examples except bitter.clj,
which does not use `defpage`.  To write it, load it in a repl, so the
code at the bottom of the page will spit the HTML.

You can also work with one page at a time; see `build.boot`.  Example:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot monitor sweeter target
----
