= Miraj: Versions of Hello-World

Miraj demo pages.

The demos are designed to be read in the following order:

1. html
2. miraj
3. polymer
4. acme-widgets

To build:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot monitor <page> target
----

where <page> is one of the tasks in `build.boot` - e.g. bitter, sweet,
sweeter, sweetest; or pages for all.

This will build all the pages defined using `defcomponent`; the others
must be serialized "manually".  The code in those includes the
necessary instructions.  In general: run the above monitor-page-target
pipeline, connect to the repl, and load the file (e.g. html/bitter.clj).
